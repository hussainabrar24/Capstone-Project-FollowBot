Discuss any resources you have used to get your project to this point. 
We are tightened up towards the budget so therefore, we decided to use cardboard for the base with a single hammered-in tetrix channel for support. 

Which parts still need to be ordered/manufactured? 
We don't need any parts to be ordered as we have all the required aparts in the lab. Furthermore, we had printed two u channels through 3D print and we need to print one more of that.

You will demonstrate at least two functional elements that work although do not need to be integrated into the larger system
➼ Drivetrain
➼ Ultrasonic Sensor Mechanism
➼ Servo control
