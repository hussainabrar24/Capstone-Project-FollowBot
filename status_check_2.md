Discuss any resources you have used to get your project to this point. 
We are tightened up towards the budget so therefore, we decided to use cardboard for the base with a single hammered-in tetrix channel for support. 

Which parts still need to be ordered/manufactured? 
We don't need any parts to be ordered as we have all the required parts in the lab. Furthermore, we had printed two u channels with PLA filament and we need to print one more of those.

You will demonstrate at least two functional elements that work although do not need to be integrated into the larger system


➼ Drivetrain


➼ Ultrasonic Sensor Mechanism
