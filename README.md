I am Abrar, an exchange student from Pakistan and a Junior at Windsor High School. I was on the robotics team this year (2022-2023) First Tech Challenge and I like 
tweaking things and try to know how they work which brings my interest in robotics.

I am Matthew, a Junior at Windsor High School and was on the robotics team of year 2021-2022 First Tech Challenge and I have great interest in technincal stuff.
I would love to persue electrical engineering in my future.

# Design Summary

Many students have to carry their backpacks on a daily basis from class to class. By using robotics, we can solve this problem by making a robot which follows the person. This project can be useful while shopping etc, as the user does not have to carry the cart all the way to the checkout and through the aisles. What if we make something that just follows that person. Our particular focus of this project is to build a lightweight (Can be modified for Heavyweights) load carrying robot with user movement.
This project will allow students and shoppers to use the robot to put their weights on it and make their life more easier by using technology and stem. It has enormous applications on a high basis like industrial use. 
The principle of object detection and monitoring is based on data accepted by both sensors. The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of an object in front of it within certain limits. If there is no object (for example our hand) in this space, both motors will stop. At the moment when an object appears in this space, the data from the infrared sensors are read, and based on the obtained data, commands are given to the motors, whereby the robot moves in the desired direction. The distance to which the infrared sensors respond is adjusted by a small trimming potentiometer.
The main idea will be like a human following robot but the one that we will be building will carry luggage etc for the user.
