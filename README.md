# Design Summary

Many students have to carry their backpacks on a daily basis from class to class. By using robotics, we can solve this problem by making a robot which follows the person. This project can be useful while shopping etc, as the user does not have to carry the cart all the way to the checkout and through the aisles. What if we make something that just follows that person. Our particular focus of this project is to build a lightweight (Can be modified for Heavyweights) load carrying robot with user movement.
With the Followbot at their side students can simply walk they need to go, and the Followbot will carry their things behind them. Students can manually change the distance that it will follow, allowing easy use in crowded hallways. The Followbot may soon diminish the need for the common backpack.

# How it will look

➼ Tank drive without treads


➼ Two wheeled drive


➼ U-Channel stand for holding the electronics


➼ A custom designed case for the electronics


➼ Cardboard for the base with a tetrix channel as a support

➼ Makeshift castor wheels

➼ Three battery packs (36 batteries)in parallel
