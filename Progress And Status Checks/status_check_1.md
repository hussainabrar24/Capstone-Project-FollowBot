                                       Project Check One Questions
1.Which parts of the project have you begun constructing to get to the final working solution?
Right now, we are almost halfway through building our drivetrain which would consist of two motors and tetrix channels as we are trying to be within our budget as
we will need more components for our robot. We are expecting to be done with our drivetrain by 3/27/2023 as we need to turn working on the other parts too. 
Overall, we had a good start towards our project and hopefully, we will be able to complete our designated tasks in time.

2.Have you ordered all additional parts that will be needed? When will they arrive if they have not already?
Most of our parts are available in the lab. We are not having parts which have been needed to be ordered. 
  
3.Have you designed any of the parts that will need to be manufactured?  If not, when will those designs be done?
As far as now, we are working on the CAD design using onshape to get a better view of the final project which will determine our need of any other custom designed 
elements. We will be done with the decision on this portion by the end of this week.

4.If you are able to complete the project by May 13th to your expectations, will you receive full credit in all five functional element categories
Yeah, we will be able to get full credit on our project but we have to improve the user interaction (input) with the robot which will fulfill the missing requirement.

 5.(list how you meet each requirement)?
We will be using components that are allowed
It will be under the budget ($100)
It will be functioning
Will need a user input
Interfaced to a controller (Switch)
Our project will be a prototype of a potential finished product
Will be a working prototype.

6.What are the three most significant design challenges you foresee for this project?
Interaction process between robot and the user (Coding).
Using Sensors to detect the user movement. 
Robotâ€™s drivetrain concept ( Turning) as we are doing rear wheel drive with no controller (Joystick).
